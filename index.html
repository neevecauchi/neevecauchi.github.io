  <h1> krita with</h1> 
  <h2> DGA 1019</h2> 
  <p> i chose to center my webpage around Krita as i really enjoy creating illustrations.
      i had used it a few times before the lectures, however i completely forgot about it until we had to make use of it for our assignment. </p>
      
      
 <h3> Why i like using Krita</h3>
 <ul>
      <li> it is free but just as good as software you would pay for</li>
          <li> very comfortable to use</li>
          <li>easy to navigate</li>

      </ul>
